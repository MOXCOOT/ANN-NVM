# ANN-NVM: Using NVM to accelerate Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

## Introduction

ANN-NVM is a high-performance framework designed to accelerate Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search by leveraging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and GPU computing. It is optimized for large-scale datasets and provides efficient indexing and querying capabilities.

## Features

- **Efficient Indexing**: Based on the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph structure.
- **NVM Integration**: Enhances data persistence and query performance using NVM.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes GPU for faster computation.
- **Scalability**: Supports datasets with millions or billions of entries.

## Performance

The table below compares the performance of direct data dump and NVM-based data dump for different dataset sizes:

| Dataset Size (entries) | Direct Dump Time (seconds) | NVM Dump Time (seconds) | Speedup |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| 1M                     |                            |                         |         |
| 10M                    |                            |                         |         |
| 50M                    |                            |                         |         |
| 100M                   |                            |                         |         |
| 500M                   |                            |                         |         |
| 1000M                  |                            |                         |         |
